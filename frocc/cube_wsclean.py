    """Construct a wsclean command.

    If False or None is passed as a parameter, the parameter is not included
    in the command (i.e. wsclean will assume a default value).

    Args:
        mslist (list): List of MSs to be processed.
        use_mpi (bool): Use wsclean-mp for parallel processing.
        version (bool, optional): Print WSClean's version and exit.
            Defaults to False.
        j (int, optional): Specify number of computing threads to use,
            i.e., number of cpu cores that will be used.
            Default: use all cpu cores. to None.
        parallel_gridding (int, optional): Will execute multiple gridders
            simultaneously. This can make things faster in certain cases,
            but will increase memory usage. Defaults to None.
        parallel_reordering (int, optional): Process the reordering with
            multipliple threads. Defaults to None.
        no_work_on_master (bool, optional): In MPI runs, do not use the master

            of the master are limited. Defaults to False.
        mem (float, optional): Limit memory usage to the given fraction of the
            total system memory. This is an approximate value.
            Default: 100. Defaults to None.

            of memory in gigabytes. Defaults to None.
        verbose (bool, optional): Increase verbosity of output.
            Defaults to False.

        quiet (bool, optional): Do not output anything but errors.
            Defaults to False.
        reorder (bool, optional): Force reordering of Measurement Set.
            This can be faster when the measurement set needs to be iterated
            several times, such as with many major iterations or in channel
            imaging mode. Default: only reorder when in channel imaging mode.
            Defaults to False.
        no_reorder (bool, optional): Disable reordering of Measurement Set.
            This can be faster when the measurement set needs to be iterated
            several times, such as with many major iterations or in channel
            imaging mode. Default: only reorder when in channel imaging mode.
            Defaults to False.
        temp_dir (str, optional): Set the temporary directory used when
            reordering files. Default: same directory as input measurement set.
            Defaults to None.
        update_model_required (bool, optional): Default. Defaults to False.
        no_update_model_required (bool, optional): These two options specify
            whether the model data column is required to contain valid model
            data after imaging. It can save time to not update the model data
            column. Defaults to False.
        no_dirty (bool, optional): Do not save the dirty image.
            Defaults to False.

            first iteration. Defaults to False.
        save_weights (bool, optional): Save the gridded weights in the a fits
            file named <image-prefix>-weights.fits. Defaults to False.
        save_uv (bool, optional): Save the gridded uv plane, i.e., the FFT of
            the residual image. The UV plane is complex, hence two images will
            be output: <prefix>-uv-real.fits and <prefix>-uv-imag.fits.
            Defaults to False.
        reuse_psf (str, optional): Load the psf(s) from the given prefix and
            skip the inversion for the psf image. Defaults to None.
        reuse_dirty (str, optional): Load the dirty from the given prefix and
            skip the inversion for the dirty image. Defaults to None.
        apply_primary_beam (bool, optional): Calculate and apply the primary
            beam and save images for the Jones components, with weighting
            identical to the weighting as used by the imager. Only available
            for instruments supported by EveryBeam. Defaults to False.
        reuse_primary_beam (bool, optional): If a primary beam image exists
            on disk, reuse those images. Defaults to False.
        use_differential_lofar_beam (bool, optional): Assume the visibilities
            have already been beam-corrected for the reference direction.
            By default, WSClean will use the information in the measurement
            set to determine if the differential beam should be applied for
            obtaining proper flux levels. Defaults to False.
        primary_beam_limit (float, optional): Level at which to trim the beam
            when performing image-based beam correction,. Default: 0.005.
            Defaults to None.
        mwa_path (str, optional): Set path where to find the MWA beam file(s).
            Defaults to None.
        save_psf_pb (bool, optional): When applying beam correction,
            also save the primary-beam corrected PSF image. Defaults to False.
        pb_grid_size (int, optional): Specify the grid size in number of
            pixels at which to evaluate the primary beam.
            Typically, the primary beam is calculated at a coarse resolution
            grid and interpolated, to reduce the time spent in evaluating the
            beam. This parameter controls the resolution of the grid at which
            to evaluate the primary beam. For rectangular images, pb-grid-size
            indicates the number of pixels along the shortest dimension.
            The total number of pixels in the primary beam grid thus amounts
            to:
                max(width, height) / min(width, height) * pb-grid-size**2.
            Default: 32. Defaults to None.
        beam_model (str, optional): Specify the beam model, only relevant for
            SKA and LOFAR. Available models are Hamaker, Lobes, OskarDipole,
            OskarSphericalWave. Input is case insensitive. Default is Hamaker
            for LOFAR and OskarSphericalWave for SKA. Defaults to None.
        beam_mode (str, optional): [DEBUGGING ONLY] Manually specify the
            beam mode. Only relevant for simulated SKA measurement sets.
            Available modes are array_factor, element and full. Input is case
            insensitive. Default is full. Defaults to None.
        beam_normalisation_mode (str, optional): [DEBUGGING ONLY]
            Manually specify the normalisation of the beam. Only relevant
            for simulated SKA measurement sets. Available modes are none,
            preapplied, full, and amplitude. Default is preapplied.
            Defaults to None.
        dry_run (bool, optional): Parses the command line and quits afterwards.
            No imaging is done. Defaults to False.
        weight (str, optional): Weightmode can be: natural, uniform, briggs.
            Default: uniform. When using Briggs' weighting, add the robustness
            parameter, like: "-weight briggs 0.5". Defaults to None.
        super_weight (float, optional): Increase the weight gridding box size,
            similar to Casa's superuniform weighting scheme. Default: 1.0
            The factor can be rational and can be less than one for subpixel
            weighting. Defaults to None.
        mf_weighting (bool, optional): In spectral mode, calculate the weights
            as if the image was made using MF. This makes sure that the sum of
            channel images equals the MF weights. Otherwise, the channel image
            will become a bit more naturally weighted. This is only relevant
            for weighting modes that require gridding (i.e., Uniform, Briggs').
            Default: off, unless -join-channels is specified.
            Defaults to False.
        no_mf_weighting (bool, optional): Opposite of -ms-weighting;
            can be used to turn off MF weighting in -join-channels mode.
            Defaults to False.
        weighting_rank_filter (float, optional): Filter the weights and set
            high weights to the local mean. The level parameter specifies the
            filter level; any value larger than level*localmean will be set to
            level*localmean. Defaults to None.
        weighting_rank_filter_size (float, optional): Set size of weighting
            rank filter. Default: 16. Defaults to None.
        taper_gaussian (str, optional): Taper the weights with a Gaussian
            function. This will reduce the contribution of long baselines.
            The beamsize is by default in asec, but a unit can be specified
            ("2amin"). Defaults to None.
        taper_tukey (float, optional): Taper the outer weights with a Tukey
            transition. Lambda specifies the size of the transition; use in
            combination with -maxuv-l. Defaults to None.
        taper_inner_tukey (float, optional): Taper the weights with a Tukey
            transition. Lambda specifies the size of the transition; use in
            combination with -minuv-l. Defaults to None.
        taper_edge (float, optional): Taper the weights with a rectangle,
            to keep a space of lambda between the edge and gridded
            visibilities. Defaults to None.
        taper_edge_tukey (float, optional): Taper the edge weights with a Tukey
            window. Lambda is the size of the Tukey transition. When
            -taper-edge is also specified, the Tukey transition starts inside
            the inner rectangle. Defaults to None.
        use_weights_as_taper (bool, optional): Will not use visibility weights
            when determining the imaging weights. This has the effect that e.g.
            uniform weighting can be modified by increasing the visibility
            weight of certain baselines. Without this option, uniform imaging
            weights absorb the visibility weight to make the weighting truly
            uniform. Defaults to False.
        store_imaging_weights (bool, optional): Will store the imaging weights
            in a column named 'IMAGING_WEIGHT_SPECTRUM'. Defaults to False.
        name (str, optional): Use image-prefix as prefix for output files.
            Default is 'wsclean'. Defaults to None.
        size (str, optional): Set the output image size in number of pixels
            (without padding). Defaults to None.
        padding (float, optional): Pad images by the given factor during
            inversion to avoid aliasing. Default: 1.2 (=20%). Defaults to None.
        scale (str, optional): Scale of a pixel. Default unit is degrees, but
            can be specificied, e.g. -scale 20asec. Default: 0.01deg.
            Defaults to None.
        predict (bool, optional): Only perform a single prediction for an
            existing image. Doesn't do any imaging or cleaning. The input
            images should have the same name as the model output images would
            have in normal imaging mode. Defaults to False.
        ws_continue (bool, optional): Will continue an earlier WSClean run.
            Earlier model images will be read and model visibilities will be
            subtracted to create the first dirty residual. CS should have been
            used in the earlier run, and model datashould have been written
            to the measurement set for this to work. Default: off.
            Defaults to False.
        subtract_model (bool, optional): Subtract the model from the
            data column in the first iteration. This can be used to reimage
            an already cleaned image, e.g. at a different resolution.
            Defaults to False.
        channels_out (int, optional): Splits the bandwidth and makes count
            nr. of images. Default: 1. Defaults to None.
        shift (str, optional): Shift the phase centre to the given location.
            The shift is along the tangential plane. Defaults to None.
        gap_channel_division (bool, optional): In case of irregular frequency
            spacing, this option can be used to not try and split channels to
            make the output channel bandwidth similar, but instead to split
            largest gaps first. Defaults to False.
        channel_division_frequencies (str, optional): Split the bandwidth at
            the specified frequencies (in Hz) before the normal bandwidth
            division is performed. This can e.g. be useful for imaging multiple
            bands with irregular number of channels. Defaults to None.
        nwlayers (int, optional): Number of w-layers to use. Default: minimum
            suggested #w-layers for first MS. Defaults to None.
        nwlayers_factor (float, optional): Use automatic calculation of the
            number of w-layers, but multiple that number by the given factor.
            This can e.g. be useful for increasing w-accuracy. Defaults to None.
        nwlayers_for_size (str, optional): Use the minimum suggested w-layers
            for an image of the given size. Can e.g. be used to increase
            accuracy when predicting small part of full image.
            Defaults to None.
        no_small_inversion (bool, optional): Perform inversion at the Nyquist
            resolution and upscale the image to the requested image size
            afterwards. This speeds up inversion considerably, but makes
            aliasing slightly worse. This effect is in most cases <1%.
            Default: on. Defaults to False.
        small_inversion (bool, optional): Perform inversion at the
            Nyquist resolution and upscale the image to the requested
            image size afterwards. This speeds up inversion considerably,
            but makes aliasing slightly worse. This effect is in most cases
            <1%. Default: on. Defaults to False.
        grid_mode (str, optional): Kernel and mode used for gridding:

            Defaults to False.
        baseline_averaging (float, optional): Enable baseline-dependent
            averaging. The specified size is in number of wavelengths
            (i.e., uvw-units). One way to calculate this is with

            details of the configuration file format. Applying a-terms is only
            possible when IDG is enabled. Defaults to None.
        grid_with_beam (bool, optional): Apply a-terms to correct for the

            joinedly cleaned (see '-joinpolarizations'), but this is not the
            default. I, Q, U and V polarizations will be directly calculated
            from the visibilities, which might require correction to get to
            real IQUV values. The 'xy' polarization will output both a real
            and an imaginary image, which allows calculating true Stokes
            polarizations for those telescopes. Defaults to None.

        spectral_correction (str, optional): Enable correction of the given
            spectral function inside deconvolution. This can e.g. avoid
            downweighting higher frequencies because of reduced flux density.
            1st term is total flux, 2nd is si, 3rd curvature, etc.
            Example: -spectral-correction 150e6 83.084,-0.699,-0.110
            Defaults to None.

        squared_channel_joining (bool, optional): Use with -join-channels to
            perform peak finding in the sum of squared values over channels,
            instead of the normal sum. This is useful for imaging QU
            polarizations with non-zero rotation measures, for which the normal
             sum is insensitive. Defaults to False.
        parallel_deconvolution (int, optional): Deconvolve subimages in

            no cleaning is performed. Defaults to None.
        restore_list (str, optional): Restore a source list onto the residual
            image and save it in output image. Except for the model input

        beam_shape (str, optional): Set the FWHM beam shape for restoring the
            clean components. Defaults units for maj and min are arcsec, and
            degrees for PA. Can be overriden,

        theoretic_beam (bool, optional): Write the beam in output fits files as
            calculated from the longest projected baseline. This method results
            in slightly less accurate beam size/integrated fluxes, but provides
             a beam size without making the PSF for quick imaging.
             Default: off. Defaults to False.
        circular_beam (bool, optional): Force the beam to be circular:
            bmin will be set to bmaj. Defaults to False.
        elliptical_beam (bool, optional): Allow the beam to be elliptical.
